# SRv6 TOI

This topology is built on Containerlabs and is intended to be an introduction to SRv6 on XRd and SONiC.  The following documentation will guide you on the implemenation

- Implementing Containerlabs for XRd (todo)
- Containerlabs CLI Cheat Sheet 
- IPv6 addressing planning for SRv6
- Interface configuration for SRv6
- Day 1 IS-IS configuration for SRv6
- Configuraton for Global IP Overlay Sevices (BGP-Free Core)
- SRv6 Automated Traffic Steering (BGP Locator-based Forwarding)
- Administrative Groups (Link Affinity) for SRv6 TE Policy
- Anycast-based BGP Routing (Egress Engineering for transit services)

In addition, the Containerlabs configuration file has been shared.  You will need to have a valid Cisco service contract to download XRd.  You can alternatively use SONiC or FRR, although functionality will vary.  SRv6 is an architecture that leverages a collection of hundreds of individual features.  Many are standardized but not all feature are implemented on all vendor implementations.
